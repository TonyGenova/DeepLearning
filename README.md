Notes on Deep Learning/Neural Networks

Some from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysVOhBGykxs&t=1792s
 - that video also has python steps for an image classifier

##### Types of Neural Networks
 - Feed Forward - data moves forward in calculation
 - Radial Basis Function - measures distance from center point
 - Recurrent Neural Networks - Hidden layer retains data for future applications
 - Convolutional Neural Networks - input data taken in batches, like a filter - picture data broken down, etc 
 
##### Input Neurons
 - reads the raw input, sends information on it to hidden layers

##### Hidden Layers
 - Have weights and biases, interact between each other
  
##### Activation Functions
 - Threshold Function - either 0 or 1 depending on threshold 
   - so, either fires or it doesn't
 - Sigmoid Function - 1/(1+e^x)
   - gives a continuous result between 0 and 1
 - RELU Function  
 - Hyperbolic Tangent Function - (1-e^-2x)/(1+e^-2x)  
   - continuous result between -1 and 1

##### Backpropogation
 - adjusts weights on each node to reduce error in output v specified target
